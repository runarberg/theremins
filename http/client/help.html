        <i>How do I use this?</i> To play simply point your mouse to a
        desired location on the rainbowed canvas, press the mouse
        button and hold it. Release the button again to silence the
        theremin.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re lucky enough to be playing on a touch screen
        display, it is enough for you to touch the canvas where you
        want to play it. Note that you can play multiple notes at the
        same time by using more than one finger.
      </p>

      <p>
        The vertical axis represents volume (up means louder) and the
        horizontal axis represents pitch (right means higher). So to
        play a loud base, click the upper left corner. And to play a
        soft high tone, press and hold somewhere above the bottom
        right corner.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>What are the strings in front of the rainbow?</i> The
         strings in front of the rainbow are sort of like notes on a
         piano. You don’t have to to use them if you don’t want
         to. But if you do, a black note on a piano is represented
         here as a repeated color. With C and C♯ as yellow, D and D♯
         as green, E as blue, etc. And if you really want to know, the
         left edge is tuned at A<sub>2</sub> = 110&nbsp;Hz, and the
         right edge is tuned at A<sub>6</sub> = 1760&nbsp;Hz.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>What are <em>jam sessions</em>?</i> If a session is to noisy
        for you, you can create a new channel simply by entering a new
        path in the address-bar of your browser, e.g.
        <a href="/my-new-channel"><code>/my-new-channel</code></a>,
        your new session will then be listed under
        <a href="/list">jam sessions</a> for others to join. If you
        want a private session start your new channel with an
        underscore, e.g.
        <a href="/_my-secret-channel"><code>/_my-secret-channel</code></a>,
        and you’re channel won’t be listed under jam sessions.
      </p>
